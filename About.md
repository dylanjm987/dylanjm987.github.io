## Some general notes

I'm a 21 year old kid from Virginia who's currently in school trying to get an AAS in Information Systems Technology. My 6th grade math teacher introduced me to coding with Codecademy and I've been sorta interested since then. I enjoy gardening, laughing, thinking about thinking, and listening to music.

The main computer I use is a 4th generation Intel NUC running Linux Mint Cinnamon Edition. 

12/13 update-- The NUC crashed so I'm using my 2015 macbook air now.

2/1 update--Bought an HP EliteDesk 800 G2 Mini running Windows 10.

## Why?
  
I'm not sure. A smart man told me that life is learning and it would be wasteful to not take full advantage of every opportunity to learn. I made this site with the intention of sharing ideas through writing but have not been writing enough. Maybe this spring I'll share pictures of the garden and what I'm working on with that.
