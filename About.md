## Who
me, i don't know who i am

## What
My main drive is to be the person that I wished I had when I was young. I enjoy gardening, listening to music, writing, laughing, thinking about thinking, and sleeping. Originally, I made this site with the intention of sharing some of my writing a few times a month .. that didn't happen. Been journaling but that's about it. Maybe I'll start using this as a journal of sorts.

## When
Hm, I guess right now, but whenever, really

## Where
Earth, Beefoo, and sometimes in between

## Why?
Still figuring this one out. The main reason _why_ I continue _doing_ anything is fear, and that's a pretty shitty reason for existing. John told me that life is learning and it would be wasteful to not take full advantage of every opportunity to learn. He's more optimistic than me, but generally, I agree with him. 

## How 
This site uses Jekyll's Minima theme. You can find source code for [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) and [Minima]((https://github.com/jekyll/minima)) on GitHub. More about [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
