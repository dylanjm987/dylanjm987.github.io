“Our lives are a response to the call of our child-hoods.” -Tariq Trotter


According to Dr. Rothman, we are the product of the choices we make about our thoughts and feelings. That's an oversimplification because it was one line in an hour long conversation but I think he's right. We have such little control over everything but we can still make choices. I believe we are the reflection of our choices surrounding our thoughts and feelings. More on this another time..
