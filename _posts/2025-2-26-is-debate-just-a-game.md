#### How does the subjective nature of debate impact its ability to be a game and what makes it an interesting game. 

There is no entirely objective way to determine the winner of a debate round, which could be implicated to argue that debate can fundamentally not be a game. The foundation of all the games that humans play are relatively clear win conditions, and if they aren't win conditions then there are usually clear rules or guidelines for how games are meant to go. It's a bit different with debate. Now that I'm typing this I'm realizing that debate is still a game, but the win conditions are much more flexible because  We would then need to define what a 'game' is, and I'm not sure I want to do that right now. 

#### What does treating debate as a game do/mean for how we engage with the activity?
