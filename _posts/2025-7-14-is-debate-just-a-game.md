#### How does the subjective nature of debate impact its ability to be a game and what makes it an interesting game?

To answer this question properly, there should be a definition for what debate is. In this context, I'm talking about american high school debate through the nsda. There is certainly room to discuss what debate is at a more fundamental level. Are debates competitions that are meant to be won? Or are they conversations that are meant to both synthesize and begin building the better world we talk about in so many rounds. 

The first part of this question is meant to imply that there is no entirely objective way to determine the winner of a debate round. This could then be implicated to argue that debate can fundamentally not be a game. How so? The foundation of all games that we play is that there are relatively clear win conditions, and if there aren't win conditions then there are usually clear rules or guidelines for how games are meant to go. Interscholastic debate is a bit different. There are set in stone speech times and speaking orders, but the only arguments that are stricly prohibited are violent ones. This means that the win conditions are more flexible because debaters can, and should, make arguments about what the win conditions are. I think the flexibility of the win conditions is what makes debate so appealing for many of us. I can only speak for myself, and I know that the rigidity of some other games is unappealing, so we do things like debate that allow us to exercise the natural intellectual freedom that we are all born with. 

#### How does treating debate as a game impact the way we engage with the activity?
