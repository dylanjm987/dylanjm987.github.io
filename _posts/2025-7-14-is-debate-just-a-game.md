#### How does the subjective nature of debate impact its ability to be a game and what makes it an interesting game. 

There is no entirely objective way to determine the winner of a debate round, which could be implicated to argue that debate can fundamentally not be a game. How? The foundation of all the games that we play are that there are relatively clear win conditions, and if there aren't win conditions then there are usually clear rules or guidelines for how games are meant to go. Interscholastic debate is a bit different. There are set in stone speech times and speaking orders, but the only arguments that are stricly prohibited are violent ones. This means that the win conditions are more flexible because debaters can, and should, make arguments about what the win conditions are. I think the flexibility of the win conditions is what makes debate so appealing for many of us. I can only speak for myself, and I know that the rigidity of some other games is unappealing. 

#### How does treating debate as a game impact the way we engage with the activity?
