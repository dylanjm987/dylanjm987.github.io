Why keep going? Why persist? When it hurts. It stings. Each day we wake up. Perform our routines. Go about our lives as if we are not even alive. I want no part of this. Please let me go. Begging to be let go while holding on as tightly as I can. If that is not the paradox of my life then I’m not sure what is. Writing in search for understanding. Some sense of clarity. What is all of this? Don’t we all want the same things?
Up and over the hill he goes
Insecurely attached to his state of being
Dreaming of running freely
Ha ha ha
It’s okay
Stop chasing
What are you running from
Away
But from what
This
Here
Now
All of it
It can’t be
This is not how it was meant to go
Weren’t we supposed to grow up
And be strong
At least
Stronger than we were
But it feels the opposite
I’m smaller than I was back then
Weaker than I’ve ever been
And this stings more than anything
That it will never come back
No
We are forced to move forward
Chase more
They say
Keep going
You can do it
But we can’t
Or maybe
It’s not that we can’t
It’s that we won’t
Because we’re human
