I sit here and think. Then I type. Then I think while I type and type while I think. It’s a game my hands play with my mind. And whoever I am, whatever this consciousness that is allowing us to communicate is, is in a constant state of flux. Each day I am born again. Waking up without knowledge of where the story left off. As though my eyelids have a way of shattering and rebuilding the windows that they are meant to protect. I’ll never know, and that’s what stings the most. Knowledge has always provided me with some sense of security. Knowing eliminates fear. Look around. Why do you think we humans have become obsessed with obtaining information? But we will never know. We think we will. But we won’t. 
Get up and go
Why?
Don’t you feel it? 
Yeah, but I’ve been told not to respond to all of my feelings
What about when there are physical sensations
That are often tied to thoughts and feelings
It’s okay
I’ll lay down
Ignore
Go away
Hide
Don’t stay
Please go
You are not going to like it here
I live out my days
With no sign of light
Is it right?
Probably not
But what is
alive because other people want me to be
I am literally alive because a few people love the shit out of me
It’s not up to me to say that the way they feel is wrong
so I’ll suffer
for what
who knows
it’s so silly
we go and we go
we worry so much
about this and about that
when we all want the same things
at our core
we want to feel safe
to be loved
every child born free
how can we not see
it seems so easy


Why keep going? Why persist? When it hurts. It stings. Each day we wake up. Perform our routines. Go about our lives as if we are not even alive. I want no part of this. Please let me go. Begging to be let go while holding on as tightly as I can. If that is not the paradox of my life then I’m not sure what is. Writing in search for understanding. Some sense of clarity. 
What is all of this? Don’t we all want the same things?
Up and over the hill he goes
Insecurely attached to his state of being
Dreaming of running freely
Ha ha ha
It’s okay
Stop chasing
What are you running from
Away
But from what
This
Here
Now
All of it
It can’t be
This is not how it was meant to go
Weren’t we supposed to grow up
And be strong
At least
Stronger than we were
But it feels the opposite
I’m smaller than I was back then
Weaker than I’ve ever been
And this stings more than anything
That it will never come back
No
We are forced to move forward
Chase more
They say
Keep going
You can do it
But we can’t
Or maybe
It’s not that we can’t
It’s that we won’t
Because we’re human
