I sit here and think. Then I type. Then I think while I type and type while I think. It’s a game my hands play with my mind. And whoever I am, whatever this consciousness that is allowing us to communicate is, is in a constant state of flux. Each day I am born again. Waking up without knowledge of where the story left off. As though my eyelids have a way of shattering and rebuilding the windows that they are meant to protect. I’ll never know, and that’s what stings the most. Knowledge has always provided me with some sense of security. Knowing eliminates fear. Look around. Why do you think we humans have become obsessed with obtaining information? But we will never know. We think we will. But we won’t. 

Get up and go
Why?
Don’t you feel it? 
Yeah, but I’ve been told not to respond to all of my feelings
What about when there are physical sensations
That are often tied to thoughts and feelings
It’s okay
I’ll lay down
Ignore
Go away
Hide
Don’t stay
Please go
You are not going to like it here
I live out my days
With no sign of light
Is it right?
Probably not
But what is
alive because other people want me to be
I am literally alive because a few people love the shit out of me
It’s not up to me to say that the way they feel is wrong
so I’ll suffer
for what
who knows
it’s so silly
we go and we go
we worry so much
about this and about that
when we all want the same things
at our core
we want to feel safe
to be loved
every child born free
how can we not see
it seems so easy
