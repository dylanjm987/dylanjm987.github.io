## Some general notes
I'm a 20 year old kid from Virginia. Currently in school trying to get an AAS in Information Systems Technology. My 6th grade math teacher introduced me to coding with Codecademy and I've been sorta interested since then. 
  
I didn't start taking my education or really anything seriously until this past year or so. I still don't know if I take things seriously but I definitely put in more effort than I used to.
  
## Why?
  
A smart man told me that life is learning and I think it would be wasteful to not take full advantage of my opportunities to learn. The goal of this site is to learn and have fun along the way. Part of that fun along the way involves gardening, laughing, thinking about thinking, and listening to music. 

## What can I expect?

Well, I hope you expect nothing. I plan to share and discuss ideas, critique my own and others' ideas, and make an honest attempt at expressing myself.

## Will it be worth my time?

Who knows?

## How often will you post?

I make no promises.
